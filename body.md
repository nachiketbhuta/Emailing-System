The state has no general sales tax, nor is personal income (other than interest and dividends) taxed at either the state or local level. It was the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, on June 21, 1788. Concord is the state capital and Manchester is the largest city. The state was named after the English county of Hampshire by Captain John Mason. Historically, New Hampshire was a major center for textile manufacturing, shoemaking and papermaking. Numerous mills were located along rivers, especially the Merrimack and the Connecticut. The New Hampshire primary is the first primary in the United States presidential election cycle.
